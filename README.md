## **NOTE: DO NOT REHOST THIS MOD.**
I've taken steps to prevent web builds of this mod from being compileable, and I'd like to keep the mod from being hosted on any websites other than the ones I choose.

## Friday Night Funkin'
**Friday Night Funkin'** is a rhythm game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop".

## Antimus
**Vs Dr Antimus** or simply **Antimus** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' with a new week containing 4 songs and an additional bonus song.
3 of these songs use 5 keys instead of the usual 4, and 4 of these songs have a new "Solo" difficulty which allows you to play the entire song without your opponent getting a turn.

Antimus runs on **Kade Engine** which you can find [here](https://KadeDev.github.io/Kade-Engine/).

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and will never be official, so don't get confused.
